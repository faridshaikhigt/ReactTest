# React Student Information Table
This React application displays student information in the form of a table. It provides details about the student's guardians, school, and other relevant information. The code has been optimized for performance.
Please note that the data used in this application is static and mimics an API call using `setTimeout` and `Promise` to simulate asynchronous behavior.
## Setup Process
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-student-information-table.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd react-student-information-table
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.
## Features
- Display student information in a table format.
- Includes details about guardians and school.
- Optimized code for improved performance.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Supports filtering and sorting of student data.
- Simulates API calls using `setTimeout` and `Promise` for a more realistic experience.
**Limitations:**
- The data used in the application is static and not fetched from a real API.
- To mimic API calls, a `setTimeout` function is used to introduce a delay before resolving a `Promise`. This delay is purely for simulation purposes and does not reflect actual network latency.
- As a result, the data may not reflect real-time changes and is not dynamic.
- Any modifications or updates to the data will not persist after refreshing the page.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue in the repository.

Enjoy using the React Student Information Table!
